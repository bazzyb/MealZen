## Devices

### Setting up devices

#### Android

To open the list of devices in Android Studio:
Android Studio -> Tools -> Device Manager

#### iOS

To open the list of devices in Xcode:
Xcode -> Window -> Devices and Simulators

In here, setup the ios devices listed below, named exactly the same, with the same specs

You'll then need to open each device via `expo run:ios`, to install the app on the simulated device.
