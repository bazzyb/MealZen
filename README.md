## Get started

1. Prepare the environment

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run prebuild # prepares native elements of app, ie. database
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm run ios
   # OR
   npm run android
   ```

## Devices

### Setting up devices

#### Android

To open the list of devices in Android Studio:
Android Studio -> Tools -> Device Manager

#### iOS

To open the list of devices in Xcode:
Xcode -> Window -> Devices and Simulators

In here, setup the ios devices listed below, named exactly the same, with the same specs

You'll then need to open each device via `expo run:ios`, to install the app on the simulated device.

## Tests

### E2E Tests

E2E tests are run using [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro).

You'll need to run the required device, before running the e2e tests

## Known Issues

- ps_crud table fills up with transactions until user syncs.
  - If user uses app for long time without syncing, this could accrue too many transactions
  - see: https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/offline-only-usage
  - might be best to find a way to look for duplicate jobs, and remove them?
  - if delete exists for id, which also has creates and edits, remove them all from ps_crud
  - if delete exists for id, which also has edits but no create, remove the edits

## Prod release TODO steps

- EAS Build - https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/
- Maestro cloud CI - https://console.mobile.dev/quickstart?teamId=36513706-3609-41ab-a5e9-e28339db6964
